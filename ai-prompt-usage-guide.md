# 📖 AI Frontend Prompt - Usage Guide & Structure

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide explains how to effectively use the master AI frontend prompt (`ai-frontend-prompt-master.md`) with various AI-powered development tools.

---

## 🏗️ Prompt Structure Breakdown

The master prompt follows the **four-part structured framework** for optimal AI code generation:

### 1. 📋 Foundational Context (Lines 1-120)
**Purpose:** Orients the AI with complete project understanding

**Includes:**
- Complete tech stack with specific versions
- Database schema with TypeScript interfaces  
- Existing UI patterns and component examples
- Design system and styling constraints
- Iranian market-specific requirements (ZarinPal, IRR currency)

**Why This Matters:** AI tools need explicit context to generate code that integrates seamlessly with existing systems rather than creating generic components.

### 2. 🎯 High-Level Goal (Lines 121-125)
**Purpose:** Clear, concise objective statement

**Contains:**
- Primary user functionality (browse, manage, view, handle)
- Specific billing dashboard capabilities
- Success criteria for the implementation

**Why This Matters:** Provides the AI with a north star to guide all implementation decisions.

### 3. 📱 Detailed Implementation Instructions (Lines 126-280)
**Purpose:** Granular, step-by-step development roadmap

**Structured as:**
- **Step 1:** File structure and organization
- **Step 2:** Mobile-first component design with exact specifications
- **Step 3:** Data integration patterns with TanStack Query
- **Step 4:** Payment gateway integration flow
- **Step 5:** Main dashboard layout with responsive code
- **Step 6:** Localization and market-specific features
- **Step 7:** Error handling and loading states

**Why This Matters:** Breaking complex tasks into sequential steps prevents AI confusion and ensures complete implementation.

### 4. 🔧 Code Examples & Strict Scope (Lines 281-380)
**Purpose:** Concrete examples and explicit boundaries

**Contains:**
- API response formats and TypeScript interfaces
- Required component imports (prevents recreation)
- Styling constraints and Tailwind patterns
- Form validation schemas
- Files to create vs. files to never modify
- Integration requirements with existing systems

**Why This Matters:** Prevents scope creep and ensures AI respects existing codebase architecture.

## 🚀 How to Use This Prompt

### Option 1: Complete Dashboard Generation
```
Copy the entire ai-frontend-prompt-master.md content and paste into:
- Vercel v0
- Lovable.ai  
- Cursor AI
- GitHub Copilot Chat
- Claude/ChatGPT
```

**Best For:** Initial scaffold of the complete billing dashboard

### Option 2: Component-by-Component Approach (Recommended)
```
1. Use Section 1 (Context) + Section 2 (Goal) as base
2. Extract specific component instructions from Section 3
3. Add relevant constraints from Section 4
4. Generate one component at a time
```

**Example:** ProductCard Component Only
```markdown
[Include Sections 1-2 from master prompt]

Create ONLY the ProductCard component with these specifications:
[Copy ProductCard instructions from Step 2]

[Include relevant constraints from Section 4]
```

**Best For:** Iterative development and refinement

### Option 3: Feature-Specific Prompts
Extract sections for specific functionality:
- **Payment Flow:** Steps 4 + ZarinPal constraints
- **Data Integration:** Step 3 + API examples
- **Mobile Responsive:** Step 2 + styling constraints

## 🎨 Customization Guidelines

### Adapting for Different Projects
Replace these sections with your project specifics:

1. **Tech Stack Section (Lines 15-25):**
   - Update package versions
   - Change UI library (Material-UI, Chakra, etc.)
   - Modify state management approach

2. **Database Schema (Lines 30-65):**
   - Replace with your actual data models
   - Update field names and types
   - Adjust relationships

3. **API Patterns (Lines 290-310):**
   - Change endpoint URLs
   - Update response formats
   - Modify authentication patterns

4. **Styling System (Lines 320-340):**
   - Replace Tailwind with your CSS framework
   - Update design tokens
   - Change responsive breakpoints

### Market-Specific Adaptations
For different markets, replace Iranian-specific content:
- Currency (IRR → USD, EUR, etc.)
- Payment gateway (ZarinPal → Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Localization requirements (Persian → your language)
- Date/number formatting preferences

## ⚡ Optimization Tips

### For Better AI Results:
1. **Be Hyper-Specific:** Include exact pixel values, color codes, and component names
2. **Provide Real Data:** Use actual API responses instead of placeholder data
3. **Include Error Scenarios:** Specify exactly how errors should be handled
4. **Mobile-First Always:** Start with mobile specs, then add desktop adaptations

### Iteration Strategy:
1. **Start Small:** Generate one component first
2. **Test & Refine:** Run the generated code and identify issues
3. **Update Prompt:** Add specific fixes to the prompt for next iteration
4. **Build Up:** Gradually add more components using refined prompt

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- ❌ Vague instructions like "make it look good"
- ❌ Assuming AI knows your existing components
- ❌ Not specifying responsive behavior
- ❌ Forgetting to include TypeScript interfaces
- ❌ Missing error handling specifications

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Generated Code

### Common Issues & Fixes:

**Issue:** Generated components don't match existing design system
**Fix:** Add more specific examples from your existing codebase to Section 1

**Issue:** TypeScript errors in generated code  
**Fix:** Include complete interface definitions in the database schema section

**Issue:** Components aren't responsive
**Fix:** Add more detailed mobile/desktop specifications in Step 2

**Issue:** API integration doesn't work
**Fix:** Provide actual API endpoint examples and response formats

**Issue:** Missing error handling
**Fix:** Be more explicit about error scenarios in Step 7
