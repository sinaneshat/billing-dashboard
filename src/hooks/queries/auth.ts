/**
 * Auth utilities have been migrated to Better Auth
 *
 * All auth functionality is now handled by:
 * - useSession() from '@/lib/auth/client' (instead of useCurrentUserQuery/useAuthSessionQuery)
 * - Better Auth provides automatic session management and prefetching
 *
 * This file is kept for reference and will be removed in a future cleanup.
 */

// This file is deprecated - all exports have been removed
// Use '@/lib/auth/client' instead
