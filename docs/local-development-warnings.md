# Local Development Warnings - Expected Behavior

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Durable Object Warnings (EXPECTED & NORMAL)

When running `npm run dev`, you will see warnings about Durable Objects not being exported. **This is completely normal and expected behavior.**

### Example Warning Messages

```
‚ñ≤ [WARNING] You have defined bindings to the following internal Durable Objects:
  - {"name":"NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE","class_name":"DOQueueHandler"}
  - {"name":"NEXT_CACHE_DO_PURGE","class_name":"BucketCachePurge"}
  These will not work in local development, but they should work in production.
```

```
workerd/server/server.c++:1885: warning: A DurableObjectNamespace in the config referenced the class "DOQueueHandler", but no such Durable Object class is exported from the worker.
```

### Why This Happens

**Durable Objects are only available at build time**, not during local development with `next dev`:

1. **Next.js Dev Mode**: Runs your app in Node.js with hot reload
2. **Durable Objects**: Are Cloudflare Workers runtime features that only exist when the worker is built and deployed
3. **OpenNext Build Process**: Injects the Durable Object classes (`DOQueueHandler`, `BucketCachePurge`) during the build step

### What This Means

| Environment | Durable Objects Available? | ISR Features Available? |
|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **`npm run dev`** (Next.js dev) | ‚ùå No | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (local simulation) |
| **`npm run preview`** (Wrangler dev) | ‚úÖ Yes (simulated) | ‚úÖ Yes (local bindings) |
| **Production Deployment** | ‚úÖ Yes (real) | ‚úÖ Yes (full functionality) |

### Impact on Development

**During `npm run dev`:**
- ‚úÖ App works normally
- ‚úÖ All routes render correctly
- ‚úÖ API endpoints function
- ‚úÖ Authentication works
- ‚úÖ Database queries work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ISR revalidation will use Next.js's default behavior (not Cloudflare's queue system)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cloudflare-specific caching features are not active

**The warnings DO NOT affect your app's functionality during development.**

### Testing ISR Features Locally

To test ISR features with actual Durable Objects locally:

```bash
# Build and run in Wrangler dev mode (simulates Workers runtime)
npm run preview
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Build your worker with OpenNext
- ‚úÖ Simulate Durable Objects locally
- ‚úÖ Use local bindings for R2, D1, KV
- ‚úÖ Test ISR revalidation queue
- ‚úÖ Test cache purge functionality

### Full ISR Testing (Production-like)

```bash
# Deploy to preview environment
npm run deploy:preview

# Visit: https://app-preview.roundtable.now
```

## üîß Summary

**These warnings are informational only and can be safely ignored during local development.**

- **Use `npm run dev`** for fast development with hot reload
- **Use `npm run preview`** when you need to test Cloudflare-specific features
- **Deploy to preview** for full production-like testing

The warnings remind you that Cloudflare Workers features (like Durable Objects) are not available in standard Next.js dev mode, but they will work correctly when deployed.
