### Impact Assessment
✓ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)  
- Database schema extensions for billing
- New API routes and middleware
- UI components with RTL support
- Integration with Iranian banking systems

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Transform existing auth boilerplate into comprehensive Iranian SaaS billing platform
- Enable automated subscription lifecycle management using ZarinPal Direct Debit
- Provide Persian-native user experience for Iranian market
- Reduce manual billing operations to zero while maintaining 95%+ payment success rate
- Support 100+ concurrent subscribers with self-service capabilities

### Background Context
The Iranian SaaS market lacks proper subscription billing infrastructure. ZarinPal provides payment processing but no subscription management, renewal automation, or billing lifecycle tools. This enhancement leverages the existing Next.js/Cloudflare architecture to create the missing subscription management layer, specifically designed for Iranian banking systems (Shetab network) and business requirements (IRR/TMN currencies, Persian language, local compliance).
