## Summary

- Security: PASS - Better Auth with session management and rate limiting
- Performance: CONCERNS - No benchmarks or metrics collection
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Basic error handling but missing resilience patterns  
- Maintainability: FAIL - No test coverage found

## Critical Issues

1. **Zero test coverage** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Untested code paths, regression bugs
   - Fix: Add Jest/Vitest setup and unit tests for core components

2. **Missing performance monitoring** (Performance)
   - Risk: No visibility into response times or bottlenecks
   - Fix: Add metrics collection and performance benchmarks

3. **No health checks or circuit breakers** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Poor fault tolerance and cascading failures
   - Fix: Implement health endpoints and resilience patterns

## Quick Wins

- Add basic test framework setup: ~4 hours
- Implement health check endpoint: ~1 hour
- Add performance logging middleware: ~2 hours
- Set up basic monitoring dashboards: ~3 hours
