# Subscription State Management - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **subscription service provider**,
I want **a robust subscription state machine that tracks user subscription lifecycle from creation to cancellation**,
So that **users have clear subscription status while the system handles state transitions automatically and reliably**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Billing database schema from Story 1.2, Direct Debit tokens from Story 2.1, existing user authentication
- Technology: TypeScript state machine, Drizzle ORM transactions, subscription status validation
- Follows pattern: Existing data validation patterns, API middleware organization
- Touch points: User context, subscription validation middleware, database transactions

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **State Machine Implementation**: Create subscription state machine with states: Active, Payment Failed, Cancelled, Suspended with proper transition rules
2. **Subscription Lifecycle**: Implement subscription creation, renewal, cancellation, and reactivation logic with proper validation
3. **Status Validation Middleware**: Create middleware for subscription-protected routes that validates current subscription status

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing user authentication and session management continues to work unchanged
5. New subscription middleware extends existing authentication patterns without replacement
6. Integration with billing database maintains referential integrity and transaction safety

**Quality Requirements:**

7. All state transitions covered by unit tests with edge case validation
8. Subscription middleware properly integrated with existing route protection patterns
9. No regression in existing authentication functionality verified through test suite

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create subscription service layer, implement state machine with proper validation, extend middleware chain
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing middleware patterns in authentication system for route protection
- **Key Constraints**: Database transaction safety, state consistency, middleware performance impact

## Definition of Done

- [x] Subscription state machine implemented with all lifecycle states
- [x] State transition rules properly validated and tested
- [x] Subscription validation middleware integrated with existing auth patterns
- [x] Database transactions ensure state consistency
- [x] Unit tests covering all state transitions and edge cases
- [x] Existing authentication functionality regression tested  
- [x] Code follows existing service layer and middleware patterns

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: State inconsistencies or subscription validation failures affecting user access
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper database transactions, comprehensive state validation, graceful error handling
- **Rollback**: Disable subscription middleware, revert to basic user authentication only

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing authentication or user management APIs
- [x] Database changes use existing billing schema with proper transactions
- [x] UI changes are not applicable for this story
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (middleware validation only)
