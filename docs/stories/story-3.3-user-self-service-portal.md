# User Self-Service Portal - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **Persian-speaking subscription user**,
I want **complete self-service capabilities to cancel subscriptions, update billing information, and manage payment methods**,
So that **I can control my subscription without contacting support while maintaining confidence in the Persian interface**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Billing dashboard from Story 3.2, subscription management APIs from Epic 2, Persian UI from Story 3.1
- Technology: React Hook Form, existing form validation patterns, subscription state management, Persian confirmation dialogs
- Follows pattern: Existing form handling and user interaction patterns, confirmation flow organization
- Touch points: Subscription state updates, payment method management, user notification system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Subscription Cancellation Flow**: Implement Persian cancellation interface with clear confirmation steps, reason collection, and immediate status updates
2. **Payment Method Management**: Create secure interface for updating Direct Debit authorization and viewing masked payment information
3. **Billing Information Updates**: Build forms for updating billing address, contact information, and subscription preferences in Persian

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing subscription management APIs continue to work unchanged with new UI interactions
5. New self-service forms follow existing form validation and error handling patterns
6. Integration with user notification system maintains existing communication channels

**Quality Requirements:**

7. All self-service actions covered by confirmation dialogs with clear Persian explanations and consequences
8. Form validation provides helpful Persian error messages following existing validation patterns
9. No regression in existing subscription management functionality verified through API testing

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create self-service components using existing form patterns, implement Persian confirmation flows
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing form handling and validation patterns from user management system
- **Key Constraints**: Persian confirmation clarity, secure payment method handling, immediate status updates
