# Payment Status Tracking and Notifications - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **subscription user**,
I want **clear payment status indicators and proactive notifications about billing issues**,
So that **I stay informed about my payment status and can quickly resolve any issues to avoid service interruption**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Payment status from Epic 2, notification system, Persian UI components, user preferences
- Technology: Real-time status updates, Persian notification templates, payment failure handling, notification preferences
- Follows pattern: Existing notification system, user preference management, status indicator patterns
- Touch points: Payment webhook system, email notifications, in-app notification display

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Payment Status Indicators**: Create clear visual status indicators for payments (Success, Pending, Failed, Retry) with Persian terminology and appropriate colors
2. **Proactive Failure Notifications**: Implement immediate notifications for payment failures with clear Persian explanations and action steps
3. **Notification Preference Management**: Build user preference interface for notification timing, channels (email, in-app), and frequency settings

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing notification system continues working with new payment-specific notification types
5. New status tracking follows established notification patterns and user preference integration
6. Integration with payment retry system provides coordinated user communication during resolution

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Payment status accurately reflects real-time payment system state with proper Persian terminology
8. Notifications provide actionable guidance for resolving payment issues without overwhelming users
9. No regression in existing notification delivery or user preference functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create payment status components, implement notification templates, integrate preference management
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing notification system and user preference patterns from account and subscription management
- **Key Constraints**: Real-time status accuracy, Persian notification clarity, notification frequency balance
