# Basic Payment Processing API - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **frontend developer**,
I want **secure API endpoints for payment initiation, verification, and webhook handling**,
So that **the application can process ZarinPal payments while integrating seamlessly with existing authentication and API patterns**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing Hono API router, Better Auth session middleware, ZarinPal client from Story 1.1
- Technology: Hono 4.9.1, Better Auth session validation, OpenAPI documentation with Scalar
- Follows pattern: Existing API routes in `/src/app/api/`, authentication middleware patterns
- Touch points: Session validation, API error handling, webhook security, OpenAPI spec

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Payment API Endpoints**: Create `/api/billing/payment/initiate` (POST) and `/api/billing/payment/verify` (POST) endpoints with proper authentication
2. **Webhook Handler**: Implement `/api/webhooks/zarinpal` (POST) endpoint for payment status notifications with signature verification
3. **API Documentation**: Add billing endpoints to existing OpenAPI specification with proper schemas and authentication requirements

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing Better Auth session middleware continues to work unchanged for protected routes
5. New endpoints follow existing Hono router organization in `/src/app/api/` structure
6. Integration with existing API error handling and response formatting patterns maintains consistency

**Quality Requirements:**

7. All endpoints covered by integration tests using existing test patterns
8. Webhook signature verification prevents unauthorized payment status changes
9. No regression in existing API functionality verified through existing test suite

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create new API routes using existing Hono patterns, extend authentication middleware for billing routes
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow `/src/app/api/auth/` patterns for route organization and middleware application
- **Key Constraints**: Cloudflare Workers request/response limits, webhook signature validation, session-based authentication

## Definition of Done

- [x] Payment initiation and verification endpoints implemented with authentication
- [x] ZarinPal webhook handler with signature verification working
- [x] Billing routes properly integrated with existing Hono router
- [x] OpenAPI documentation updated with new endpoints
- [x] Integration tests passing for all new endpoints  
- [x] Existing API functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing API patterns and error handling conventions

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Webhook security vulnerabilities or authentication bypass in billing routes  
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper signature verification, extend existing auth middleware patterns
- **Rollback**: Remove billing route files, revert API router configuration

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs or authentication system
- [x] Database changes use schema from Story 1.2 without additional modifications
- [x] UI changes are not applicable for this story
- [x] Performance impact is negligible (additional API routes only)
