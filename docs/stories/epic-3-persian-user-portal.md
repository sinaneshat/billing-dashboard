# Persian User Self-Service Portal - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Create a fully localized Persian/Farsi user interface for subscription management, providing Iranian users with native-language billing dashboard and self-service capabilities.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Complete subscription lifecycle from Epics 1-2, existing Shadcn UI components, next-intl framework
- Technology stack: Subscription APIs established, billing middleware, authentication system
- Integration points: User dashboard layout, existing component library, internationalization system

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Persian locale files, RTL component variants, billing dashboard pages
- How it integrates: Extends existing `/app/(app)/` layout with `/billing/*` routes, adds Persian to next-intl configuration
- Success criteria: Complete Persian UI for subscription management, RTL layout support, Iranian currency display

## Stories

2. **Story 2:** Subscription Management Dashboard
