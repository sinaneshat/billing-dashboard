# Subscription Upgrade and Downgrade Management - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As an **active subscriber**,
I want **intuitive upgrade and downgrade options with clear billing impact and timing control**,
So that **I can adjust my subscription plan based on changing needs while understanding exactly what I'll be charged**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Subscription state management from Epic 2, plan comparison from Story 5.1, billing calculation APIs
- Technology: Prorated billing calculations, plan change timing options, billing preview, confirmation flows
- Follows pattern: Existing user action confirmation, billing preview patterns, subscription modification flows
- Touch points: Subscription modification APIs, billing calculation system, user notification flows

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Plan Change Interface**: Build upgrade/downgrade selection with clear feature comparison between current and target plans in Persian
2. **Billing Impact Preview**: Implement prorated billing calculation display showing exact charges, credits, and next billing cycle changes
3. **Timing Control Options**: Provide immediate change vs. next-billing-cycle options with clear explanations of billing implications

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing subscription modification APIs continue working with new user interface
5. New plan change interface follows established confirmation and billing preview patterns
6. Integration with billing system maintains accurate prorated calculations and charge processing

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Billing calculations accurately reflect prorated charges with proper Iranian currency formatting
8. Plan change confirmations clearly explain billing impact and service changes in Persian
9. No regression in existing subscription management or billing calculation functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create plan change components with billing preview, implement timing controls, integrate confirmation flows
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing billing preview and user confirmation patterns from payment and subscription flows
- **Key Constraints**: Prorated billing accuracy, Persian billing terminology, immediate vs. scheduled change handling
