# Payment Method Display and Management - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As an **existing subscription user**,
I want **to view, update, and manage my saved Iranian bank cards with clear security and easy removal options**,
So that **I can maintain control over my payment methods while keeping my billing information current**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Stored payment methods from Story 4.1, subscription management from Epic 2, Persian UI components
- Technology: Masked card display, Iranian bank branding, card management API, confirmation dialogs
- Follows pattern: Existing data display patterns, user action confirmation flows, secure information handling
- Touch points: Payment method APIs, user authentication, subscription status validation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Card Display Interface**: Show saved cards with proper masking (last 4 digits), Iranian bank logos/names, and card type identification in Persian
2. **Card Management Actions**: Implement update card details, remove payment method, and set primary card functionality with clear confirmation flows
3. **Security Information Display**: Show card verification status, last usage date, and security indicators with Persian explanations

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing payment method storage and retrieval APIs continue working without modification
5. New management interface follows established user action patterns and confirmation requirements
6. Integration with subscription system maintains payment method dependencies and validation

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Card information properly masked and displayed with accurate Iranian bank identification
8. Management actions covered by clear confirmation dialogs with consequence explanations in Persian
9. No regression in existing payment processing or subscription functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create card management components using existing display patterns, implement secure update flows
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing user data management patterns from profile and account settings
- **Key Constraints**: Card data security, Iranian bank identification accuracy, payment method dependency validation
