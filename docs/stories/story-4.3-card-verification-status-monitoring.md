# Card Verification and Status Monitoring - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **subscription user with payment methods**,
I want **clear visibility into my card verification status and easy options to resolve verification issues**,
So that **my subscriptions continue without interruption and I understand any payment method problems**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: ZarinPal verification APIs, payment method management from Story 4.2, notification system
- Technology: Real-time status updates, Persian status messaging, verification retry flows, expiration tracking
- Follows pattern: Existing status display patterns, user notification flows, action-oriented interfaces
- Touch points: ZarinPal status webhooks, payment verification APIs, user notification preferences

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Verification Status Display**: Show clear card verification status with Persian terminology (Verified, Pending, Failed, Expired) and visual indicators
2. **Issue Resolution Interface**: Provide retry verification flows for failed cards and clear guidance for resolving Iranian banking issues
3. **Proactive Expiration Management**: Display card expiration warnings with renewal reminders and update prompts in Persian

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing payment verification APIs continue working with new status display interface
5. New status monitoring follows established notification and user action patterns
6. Integration with subscription system prevents service interruption due to payment method issues

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Verification status accurately reflects ZarinPal API responses with proper error handling
8. Issue resolution flows provide actionable guidance in Persian with Iranian banking context
9. No regression in existing payment verification or subscription management functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create status monitoring components, implement retry flows, integrate with existing notification system
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing status display patterns from subscription and user account management
- **Key Constraints**: ZarinPal API status accuracy, Iranian banking verification complexity, real-time status updates

## Definition of Done

- [x] Card verification status clearly displayed with Persian terminology and visual indicators
- [x] Verification retry flows implemented for failed or expired cards
- [x] Proactive expiration warnings with renewal guidance in Persian
- [x] Status monitoring properly integrated with subscription dependency validation
- [x] Verification and retry functionality thoroughly tested with various card states
- [x] Existing payment verification functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing status display and notification patterns

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Inaccurate verification status display causing user confusion or subscription interruption
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive API error handling, clear Persian messaging, proactive issue resolution guidance
- **Rollback**: Disable advanced status monitoring, revert to basic verification status only

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing payment verification or subscription APIs
