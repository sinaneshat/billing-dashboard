# Subscription Lifecycle Management - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement automated subscription lifecycle management with Direct Debit authorization, building on the established ZarinPal foundation to enable recurring billing without manual intervention.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: ZarinPal foundation from Epic 1, user authentication, billing database schema
- Technology stack: ZarinPal client established, billing API routes, subscription tables
- Integration points: Billing middleware, payment processing endpoints, user context

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Direct Debit token management, subscription state machine, automated billing cycle
- How it integrates: Extends billing API with Direct Debit flows, adds subscription status to user context
- Success criteria: Users can authorize Direct Debit, subscriptions auto-renew monthly, failed payments handled gracefully

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Direct Debit Authorization Flow
   - Implement ZarinPal Direct Debit API integration for token creation
   - Create secure token storage with encryption
   - Build authorization confirmation and status tracking

2. **Story 2:** Subscription State Management
   - Create subscription state machine (Active → Payment Failed → Cancelled/Suspended)
   - Implement subscription creation, renewal, and cancellation logic
   - Add subscription status validation middleware

3. **Story 3:** Automated Monthly Billing Process
   - Build monthly billing job using Cloudflare Workers Cron
   - Implement payment retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Create billing failure notification system

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] ZarinPal foundation APIs from Epic 1 remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes maintain existing relationships
- [x] Cron jobs do not impact existing application performance
- [x] Subscription middleware extends (not replaces) existing auth

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Automated billing failures affecting user access or data integrity
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive retry logic, graceful failure handling, subscription grace periods
- **Rollback Plan:** Manual billing fallback, subscription status reset procedures

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Direct Debit authorization working in ZarinPal sandbox
- [x] Subscription state transitions tested thoroughly
- [x] Monthly billing automation verified without system impact
- [x] No regression in payment processing from Epic 1
