# Subscription Management Dashboard - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **subscribed Iranian user**,
I want **a comprehensive Persian billing dashboard that shows my subscription status, plan details, and payment history**,
So that **I can monitor my subscription and payments in my native language with clear Iranian financial terminology**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Subscription state management from Epic 2, Persian localization from Story 3.1, existing app layout
- Technology: Next.js app router, existing dashboard layout patterns, billing API endpoints, Persian UI components
- Follows pattern: Existing `/app/(app)/` layout structure, dashboard component organization
- Touch points: User session context, subscription data fetching, existing navigation and layout components

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Billing Dashboard Pages**: Create `/app/(app)/billing/` route structure with subscription overview, plan details, and payment history pages
2. **Subscription Plan Interface**: Build plan comparison table with Iranian Rial/Toman pricing and feature descriptions in Persian
3. **Payment History Display**: Implement chronological payment history with ZarinPal transaction IDs, status indicators, and Persian date formatting

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing app layout and navigation structure continues to work unchanged with new billing section
5. New billing pages follow existing dashboard page patterns and authentication requirements  
6. Integration with subscription APIs maintains existing data fetching and state management approaches

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Billing dashboard pages fully functional in Persian with proper RTL layout and Iranian currency display
8. Payment history accurately reflects ZarinPal transaction data with proper status translation
9. No regression in existing dashboard functionality verified through existing test suite

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend existing app layout with billing section, create dashboard components using established patterns
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing dashboard page structure and component organization patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Persian date formatting, Iranian financial terminology accuracy, RTL dashboard layouts

## Definition of Done

- [x] Complete billing dashboard section created under `/app/(app)/billing/` 
- [x] Subscription plan comparison interface with Persian terminology and Iranian pricing
- [x] Payment history display with proper Persian date and currency formatting
- [x] Dashboard components properly integrated with existing layout and navigation
- [x] Persian UI fully functional with accurate financial terminology
- [x] Existing dashboard functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing app router and component organization patterns

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Persian financial terminology inaccuracies or RTL layout issues affecting user comprehension
- **Mitigation**: Native speaker review of financial terms, comprehensive RTL testing, progressive enhancement
- **Rollback**: Hide billing dashboard section, revert to API-only billing management

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing dashboard or navigation APIs
- [x] Database changes are not applicable for this story (uses existing billing APIs)
- [x] UI changes are isolated to new billing section without affecting existing pages
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (additional dashboard pages with proper code splitting)
