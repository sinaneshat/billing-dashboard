# Subscription Cancellation and Reactivation Flow - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **subscription user**,
I want **clear cancellation options with retention attempts and easy reactivation for cancelled subscriptions**,
So that **I can control my subscription lifecycle while understanding consequences and having options to return**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Subscription state management from Epic 2, user retention flows, reactivation APIs
- Technology: Cancellation confirmation flows, retention attempt logic, reactivation interface, reason collection
- Follows pattern: Existing user action confirmation, retention flow patterns, subscription lifecycle management
- Touch points: Subscription cancellation APIs, user feedback collection, reactivation billing flows

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Cancellation Flow with Retention**: Build cancellation interface with retention attempts (discounts, downgrades) and clear consequence explanation in Persian
2. **Cancellation Reason Collection**: Implement feedback collection with Persian reason options and optional detailed feedback for service improvement
3. **Reactivation Interface**: Create reactivation flow for cancelled/suspended subscriptions with plan selection and billing restart options

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing subscription cancellation APIs continue working with new user interface and retention logic
5. New cancellation flow follows established confirmation patterns with retention attempt integration
6. Integration with subscription reactivation maintains billing continuity and user account integrity

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Cancellation process clearly explains access timeline and data retention in Persian
8. Retention attempts provide genuine value options without being pushy or confusing
9. No regression in existing subscription management or user account functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create cancellation flow with retention logic, implement reactivation interface, integrate feedback collection
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing user action confirmation and retention patterns from account management
- **Key Constraints**: Persian retention messaging, genuine value retention offers, clean reactivation billing

## Definition of Done

- [x] Cancellation flow with retention attempts and clear consequence explanations in Persian
- [x] Cancellation reason collection with Persian options and optional detailed feedback
- [x] Reactivation interface for cancelled subscriptions with plan and billing options
- [x] Retention attempts provide genuine value without compromising user experience
- [x] Cancellation and reactivation flows thoroughly tested with various scenarios
- [x] Existing subscription functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing confirmation flow and retention patterns

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Overly aggressive retention attempts creating negative user experience or unclear cancellation consequences
- **Mitigation**: Respectful retention offers, clear consequence explanations, easy final cancellation option
- **Rollback**: Disable retention attempts, simplify to direct cancellation flow

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing subscription cancellation or user account APIs
- [x] Database changes use existing subscription schema for cancellation and reactivation tracking
- [x] UI changes follow established confirmation flow patterns and Persian localization
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (cancellation flow and retention logic only)
