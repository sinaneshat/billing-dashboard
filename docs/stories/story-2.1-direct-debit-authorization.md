# Direct Debit Authorization Flow - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **subscription user**,
I want **to authorize automatic monthly payments from my Iranian bank account through ZarinPal Direct Debit**,
So that **my subscription renews automatically without manual intervention while maintaining security and banking compliance**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: ZarinPal client from Story 1.1, billing database schema from Story 1.2, payment API from Story 1.3
- Technology: ZarinPal Direct Debit API, existing authentication system, encrypted token storage
- Follows pattern: Existing secure data handling patterns, API endpoint organization
- Touch points: User session validation, payment verification flows, database token storage

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Direct Debit Token Creation**: Implement ZarinPal Direct Debit API integration to create and store encrypted payment tokens linked to user bank cards
2. **Authorization Flow**: Create secure multi-step authorization process with bank card validation, confirmation, and Iranian banking (Shetab) network compatibility
3. **Token Management**: Store Direct Debit tokens securely with encryption at rest and proper expiration handling

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing payment processing from Story 1.3 continues to work unchanged for one-time payments
5. New Direct Debit functionality extends existing billing API routes following established patterns
6. Integration with current user authentication maintains existing session security

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Direct Debit authorization covered by integration tests with ZarinPal sandbox environment
8. Token encryption/decryption follows existing security standards and Iranian banking compliance
9. No regression in existing payment functionality verified through existing test suite

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend ZarinPal client with Direct Debit methods, add encrypted token storage to billing schema
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing secure credential handling patterns from Better Auth system
- **Key Constraints**: Iranian banking compliance, Shetab network requirements, token security standards

## Definition of Done

- [x] ZarinPal Direct Debit API integration implemented and tested in sandbox
- [x] Multi-step authorization flow with bank card validation working
- [x] Secure token storage with encryption implemented
- [x] Iranian banking (Shetab) network compatibility verified
- [x] Integration tests passing for complete authorization flow
- [x] Existing payment functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing security and encryption patterns

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Direct Debit token security breach or Iranian banking compliance failure
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper encryption at rest, follow existing security patterns, validate Shetab compatibility
- **Rollback**: Disable Direct Debit features, fallback to manual payment processing

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing payment processing APIs
- [x] Database changes extend billing schema without affecting existing tables
- [x] UI changes are not applicable for this story
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (token storage and validation)
