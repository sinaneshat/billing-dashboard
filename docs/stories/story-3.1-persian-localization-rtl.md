# Persian Localization and RTL Support - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As an **Iranian user**,
I want **a fully localized Persian/Farsi interface with proper RTL layout and Iranian currency formatting**,
So that **I can manage my subscription in my native language without language barriers or cultural confusion**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing next-intl internationalization, Shadcn/UI components, Tailwind CSS styling
- Technology: next-intl 4.1.0, RTL CSS utilities, Iranian Rial/Toman currency formatting, Persian typography
- Follows pattern: Existing locale file organization, component internationalization patterns
- Touch points: Component library extension, CSS direction handling, currency formatting utilities

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Persian Locale Files**: Create comprehensive Persian translations for all billing terminology, error messages, and UI labels in `/messages/fa.json`
2. **RTL Component Variants**: Implement RTL-compatible versions of existing Shadcn components without breaking LTR layouts
3. **Iranian Currency Formatting**: Create utilities for proper Iranian Rial (IRR) and Toman (TMN) display with Persian numerals and formatting conventions

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing English UI components and layouts continue to work unchanged in LTR mode
5. New RTL implementation follows existing next-intl configuration patterns and component structure
6. Integration with existing Tailwind CSS system maintains current styling approach

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Persian translations reviewed for accuracy by native speakers and cover all billing terminology
8. RTL layouts tested across all major browsers and maintain existing component functionality
9. No regression in existing English UI functionality verified through visual testing

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend next-intl configuration, create RTL CSS utilities, implement direction-aware components
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing locale file structure and component internationalization patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Persian typography requirements, RTL CSS complexity, currency formatting accuracy
